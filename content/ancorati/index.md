for bells, violin, accordion and Live Electronics. 

This piece is inspired by the poem "Earth Gods" by Khalil Gibral. 

The three instruments are isoleted by walls, rooms, and other things that are meant to them be distant, between each other. 

Bells as memories. 
Violin as a mormour. 
Accordion as a far away being. 

And then something.
